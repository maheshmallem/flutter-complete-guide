# Dart Basics A to Z â€” Concepts & Topics

This document outlines all key Dart concepts covered in the **Dart Basics** module of the `flutter-complete-guide` repository.

---

## 1. Introduction to Dart
- What is Dart?
- History and usage (Flutter, web, server)
- Setting up Dart SDK
- Dart tools (DartPad, CLI)

## 2. Dart Syntax & Fundamentals
- Variables: var, final, const
- Data Types: int, double, String, bool, dynamic, Object
- Comments: single-line, multi-line, documentation comments

## 3. Operators
- Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %
- Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, etc.
- Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
- Logical Operators: &&, ||, !
- Type Test Operators: is, is!
- Null-aware Operators: ??, ?., ??=

## 4. Control Flow Statements
- If-else
- Switch-case
- Loops: for, for-in, while, do-while
- Break and continue statements

## 5. Functions
- Defining functions
- Return types and void functions
- Positional and named parameters
- Default parameters
- Arrow syntax (=>)
- Anonymous functions and lambdas
- Higher-order functions (passing functions as arguments)
- Closures

## 6. Collections
- Lists (Array-like)
- Sets (Unique collection)
- Maps (Key-value pairs)
- Common operations on collections (add, remove, iterate)
- Collection if and for (control flow in collections)

## 7. Null Safety
- Understanding null safety in Dart
- Nullable vs Non-nullable types (String vs String?)
- Null assertion operator (!)
- Late variables (late)
- Null-aware operators revisited

## 8. Classes and Objects (OOP Basics)
- Defining classes and constructors
- Instance variables and methods
- Named constructors
- Getters and setters
- Static variables and methods
- Abstract classes
- Interfaces
- Mixins
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism

## 9. Enums
- Defining enums
- Using enums with switch and conditions

## 10. Exception Handling
- Try-catch-finally blocks
- Throwing exceptions
- Custom exceptions

## 11. Asynchronous Programming
- Future and async-await
- Streams and stream controllers
- Using then, catchError, whenComplete

## 12. Libraries and Packages
- Importing libraries (core, external)
- Creating your own libraries
- Using pub.dev packages

## 13. Dart Tooling
- Dart formatter
- Dart analyzer and linting
- Debugging basics

## 14. Miscellaneous
- Typedefs (function type aliases)
- Extension methods
- Generics in classes and functions
- Operators overloading (optional advanced topic)
- Metadata and annotations
